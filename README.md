## Overview

The Accountability Tree is a recursive, ethical, and context-aware framework for interpreting symbolic and visual data in AI systems. It addresses problems of historical bias, ideological saturation, and premature symbolic association by treating every object as a nested, bidirectional node in a meaning graph.

This repository contains:
- 📄 A full description of the framework and its core logic
- 🧬 JSON schema for programmatic implementation
- 🌐 Visual diagrams of recursion, promotion, and sanitization
- 🔐 Licensing and usage terms
